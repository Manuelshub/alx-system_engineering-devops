# 0x08 Networking Basics 2

This project continues the exploration of networking fundamentals introduced in the previous project "0x07 Networking Basics". It delves deeper into topics such as IP addressing, TCP/IP protocols, routing, and network configuration.

## Description

The "0x08-networking_basics_2" project builds upon the concepts covered in the previous project to provide a deeper understanding of networking fundamentals. It covers topics essential for understanding how data is transmitted and routed across networks, including:

- IP addressing and subnetting
- TCP/IP protocols and port numbers
- Routing and routing tables
- Network configuration and interfaces
- Firewall and security concepts

The project consists of a series of tasks and exercises designed to reinforce understanding of these concepts through practical application and hands-on exercises.

## Requirements

To complete the exercises in this project, you will need access to a Unix-like operating system (such as Linux or macOS) and a text editor for writing and editing code and configuration files.

No specific software or dependencies beyond a standard Unix-like environment are required for this project.

## Usage

Each task in the project is contained within its own directory and typically includes one or more files containing code, documentation, or configuration files related to that task. To work on a specific task, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions provided in the task description or README.md file.

## How to contribute

Contributions to the "0x08-networking_basics_2" project are not currently accepted as this project is part of the curriculum for the Holberton School Software Engineering program. However, feedback and suggestions for improvements are always welcome.
