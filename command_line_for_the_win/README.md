Steps:
Take screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.
Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox environment.
Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.
Use the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
Once the screenshots are transferred, proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.
Include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your project’s README.md file. This will help the reviewers understand how you performed the file transfer using SFTP.

NOTE:
The screenshots of completed levels should be inside the directory /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
