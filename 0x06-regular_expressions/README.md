## Examples

### Example 1: Matching Email Addresses in Python

```python
import re

# Regular expression to match email addresses
email_pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'

# Sample usage
email = "user@example.com"
if re.match(email_pattern, email):
    print(f"{email} is a valid email address.")
else:
    print(f"{email} is not a valid email address.")
